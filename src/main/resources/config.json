    "Big town, synthetic apparitions of not being lonely.",
    "I don't want to be your friend, I want to kiss your neck.",
    "Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram. You call yourself a friend?",
    "And Danny says we’re living in a simulation, but he works in a petrol station (selling petrol).",
    "Don’t fall in love with the moment and think you’re in love with the girl.",
    "I love you. Don't you mind? Don't you mind?",
    "Hey kids, we're all just the same, what a shame.",
    "It's my party and I'll cry to the end. You must try harder than kissing all of my friends.",
    "When the smoke is in your eyes, you look so alive.",
    "Babe, you so cool.",
    "For you are not beside but within me.",
    "We're all human, we're just like you man.",

    "I don't want your body, but I hate to think about you with somebody else.",
    "This is a story about a lonely, lonely man.",
    "I'm scared of dying, no gun required.",
    "You build it to a high to say goodbye because you're not the same as them.",
    "All I do is sit and think about you."
